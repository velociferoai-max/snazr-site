  <h1>How to Stop Being Called Quiet at Work</h1>
  <p>Being called “quiet” at work can make you feel misunderstood. You don’t have to become loud—you just need small habits that change what people notice.</p>

  <h2>1) Speak Early (Not All the Time)</h2>
  <p>Say one short comment or question in the <strong>first 5 minutes</strong> of a meeting. That tiny moment resets how people see you.</p>

  <h2>2) Use Tiny Small Talk Prompts</h2>
  <p>As you pass coworkers: “How did that project go?” or “Did you see the new update?” Micro-interactions add up.</p>

  <h2>3) Reframe “Quiet” as “Focused”</h2>
  <p>If someone says, “You’re quiet,” smile: “I like to think before I speak—it helps me make better points.”</p>

  <h2>4) Exit Chats Smoothly</h2>
  <p>Try: “Great chat—gotta jump back to this task, but let’s catch up later.” You end confident, not awkward.</p>
